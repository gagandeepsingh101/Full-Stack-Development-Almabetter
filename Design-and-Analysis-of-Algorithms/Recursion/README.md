# Summary of Recursion
- Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.

- JavaScript supports recursion, allowing a function to call itself with modified parameters.

- Recursive functions have a base case (stopping condition) and a recursive case (continuation condition).

- Recursion involves calling a function within itself, while loops iterate through code blocks.

- Recursion is suitable for problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.

- Examples include traversing trees, sorting algorithms, searching arrays, generating permutations, solving maze problems, and parsing expressions.

- Recursive function time complexity depends on the number of recursive calls and the work done in each call.
