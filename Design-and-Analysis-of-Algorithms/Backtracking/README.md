# Summary of Backtracking
- Backtracking is a method used in programming that involves trying out all possible solutions to a problem and selecting the best one.

- This method is useful for solving problems that have a large number of potential solutions or when the optimal solution is difficult to find.

- In JavaScript, backtracking can be implemented using recursion.

- Some common examples of problems that can be solved using backtracking in JavaScript include the N-Queens problem and the Sudoku puzzle.

- For backtracking algorithms, the time complexity is typically mentioned as O(2^n), which means that the time taken by the algorithm increases exponentially with the size of the input problem.

- The space complexity is usually mentioned as O(n), which means that the amount of memory or storage space required by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input problem.

- It is important to note that while time complexity and space complexity are crucial factors in analyzing the efficiency of an algorithm, there is often a trade-off between time and space. In some cases, reducing the time complexity may increase the space complexity and vice versa
