# Modern Javascript Concept

### 1. Functional programming

1. Functional programming emphasizes writing pure and compound functions and avoiding mutable data, shared state, and side effects.

2. Pure functions are predictable, reusable, and easier to test and debug.

3. Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects, which means they can be treated as variables and stored, passed, and returned like any other object.

4. Higher-order functions take or return functions as arguments, and function composition is the process of chaining functions together to produce a final result.

5. The const keyword declares a constant value that cannot be reassigned, but the contents of a const variable can still be modified unless you use Object.freeze() or a library like Immutable.js.

6. The spread syntax can also be used to create a new copy of an object or array and maintain immutability.

7. Functional programming is a declarative programming paradigm that focuses on what the program does, while imperative programming focuses on how it does it. Declarative programming is a layer of abstraction on top of imperative programming, which ultimately compiles instructions for the CPU.

### 2. ES5 and ES6 Concept
1. ES6 or ECMAScript 2015 introduced several new features and enhancements to the JavaScript language, including arrow functions, classes, let and const declarations, template literals, destructuring assignment, spread syntax, function parameter defaults, promises, and modules.

2. JavaScript modules or ECMAScript modules allow developers to organize their code into reusable and maintainable modules by using a standardized module syntax.

3. There are several types of JavaScript module systems available, including CommonJS, AMD, UMD, and ES modules.

4. The "use strict" directive in ECMAScript 5 enables programmers to use a stricter JavaScript mode that helps them avoid frequent errors and enhances code quality.

### 3. RegExp and Debugging in JavaScript
1. Regular expressions in JavaScript are used to validate, search, manipulate, and extract information from strings. They are created using the RegEx constructor or by enclosing a pattern in forward slashes. 

2. Regular expressions can perform tasks such as validation, searching, replacing, and extracting information from a string. 

3. The RegEx object provides methods like test(), exec(), match(), search(), replace(), and split() to perform operations on strings. Regular expressions can be complex, but with practice, they can be a helpful tool in your JavaScript applications.

4. Browser debugging is an essential skill for JavaScript developers as it helps identify and fix problems in code. 

5. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools for debugging JavaScript code in real time. Standard techniques include console logging, setting breakpoints, using the call stack and scope chain, and inspecting the DOM. 

6. Debugging can take time to get used to. Still, utilizing these techniques and becoming familiar with browser developer tools makes it easier to identify and fix problems in JavaScript code quickly.
