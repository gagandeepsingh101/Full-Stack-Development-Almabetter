# **Summary**

## 1. Variable declaration using **var** , **let** and **const**

1. JavaScript is a programming language that is interpreted, high-level, and dynamic and is utilized to develop interactive and dynamic web pages and applications.

2. It is essential for adding interactivity and dynamic elements to websites, allowing developers to create complex and responsive user interfaces, validate user input, and communicate with back-end systems.

3. JavaScript is popular due to its versatility, ability to run on various platforms, large and active community, and rich library and tools ecosystem.

4. It powers the internet by enabling dynamic, interactive, and engaging website user experiences, allowing for real-time updates and communication with back-end systems, and making it possible to create complex and responsive web applications.

5. Cross-browser compatibility and standards compliance are crucial aspects of web development. JavaScript developers must be aware of compatibility issues and write code that follows web standards to ensure their websites are accessible and functional for all users.

6. Variables in JavaScript are containers that hold a value and can be referenced by a name. They can be declared using the "var", "let", or "const" keywords and store different data types.

7. Variables can have different scopes, including global, local, and block-level scopes, depending on where they are defined in the code.

## 2. **Operators** in using in JavaScript

1. JavaScript operators are symbols that perform actions on values and return a result.
They are a fundamental aspect of the language and allow developers to perform operations such as arithmetic, comparison, and assignment.

2. Arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), and division (/).

3. Comparison operators are used for comparing two values and return a Boolean result (true or false). Examples include equality (==), inequality (!=), greater than (>), and less than (<).

4. Assignment operators serve the purpose of assigning a value to a variable. The most common assignment operator is the equal sign (=).

5. Logical operators: These operators perform logical operations such as AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).

6. Ternary operator: This operator is a shorthand for an if-else statement and returns one of two values based on a condition.

7. JavaScript provides a range of methods for working with strings.

   1. Some common methods include .length(to find the length of a string), .substring()(to extract a portion of a string), .indexOf()(to find the position of a substring), .toLowerCase()(to convert a string to lowercase), and .toUpperCase()(to convert a string to uppercase).

   2. In JavaScript, there is a variety of built-in functions available to manipulate strings, including parseInt() for converting strings to integers, split() for dividing a string into an array of substrings, and replace() for substituting a substring within a string.

## 3. **Type conversion** in JavaScript
In programming, type conversion is the process of converting data of one type to another. For example: converting String data to Number.

There are two types of type conversion in JavaScript.

   1. Implicit or Coercion Conversion - automatic type conversion
   
   2. Explicit Conversion or Type casting - manual type conversion
